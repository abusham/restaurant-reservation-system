## Project Structure
### Components
#### ‚Ä¢ Layout: AppHeader.vue / AppFooter.vue
#### ‚Ä¢ UI: BaseButton.vue - Button component / BaseModal.vue - Base modal wrapper
#### ‚Ä¢ Modals: ConfirmationModal.vue - Generic confirmation dialog  / AddBranchesModal.vue - Enable reservations for branches / EditBranchModal.vue - Edit branch reservation settings
#### ‚Ä¢ Reservations: ReservationsTable.vue - Main table displaying branches

### Composables - Vue composables for shared logic
#### ‚Ä¢ useReservations.ts - Reservation state and business logic

### Directives - Custom Vue directives
#### ‚Ä¢ clickOutside.ts - Click-outside detection directive

### Pages
#### ‚Ä¢ reservations.vue - Main reservations page
#### ‚Ä¢ not-found.vue - 404 page

### Services - API communication layer
#### ‚Ä¢ api.ts - API service

### Types - TypeScript type definitions
#### ‚Ä¢ reservations.ts - Reservation-related interfaces

### Routes
#### ‚Ä¢ routes.ts - App routes

### Vite
#### ‚Ä¢ vite.config.ts - contains server proxy to overcome CORS locally

## Features
#### ‚Ä¢ View all branches with reservations enabled
#### ‚Ä¢ Enable reservations for new branches (multi-select)
#### ‚Ä¢ Edit branch settings: duration and time slots per day (up to 3 slots)
#### ‚Ä¢ Disable reservations per branch or all branches at once
#### ‚Ä¢ Fully responsive design

## API Integrations
#### ‚Ä¢  GET /branches?include[0]=sections&include[1]=sections.tables - Fetch branches with nested sections and tables
#### ‚Ä¢  PUT /branches/:id - Update branch settings (enable/disable reservations, duration, time slots)
#### The application makes parallel API calls when enabling/disabling multiple branches, then refreshes data once to minimize network requests.

## Architecture Decisions
#### ‚Ä¢ Singleton Composable Pattern - useReservations.ts uses shared state (defined outside the function) to ensure all components accessing the composable share the same data, preventing duplicate API calls and keeping the UI in sync.
#### ‚Ä¢ Service Layer - api.ts handles all API communication with proper error handling, authentication, response normalization and centralized toast usage.
#### ‚Ä¢ TypeScript - Full type safety with interfaces in types/reservations.ts for better developer experience and compile-time error detection.
#### ‚Ä¢ Vite Proxy - Configured to proxy /api/* requests to Foodics API, avoiding CORS issues during development.
#### ‚Ä¢ Unified Modal Component - BaseModal.vue provides reusable modal structure with header, content, and footer slots, reducing code duplication across different modal types.

## Known Limitations & Possible Improvements
#### ‚Ä¢ Pagination Challenges: The API returns paginated results (50 branches per page), but the requirement to filter only branches with accepts_reservations: true makes traditional pagination impractical. To properly implement pagination, we would need either: A server-side filter parameter (e.g., ?accepts_reservations=true) or start displaying all branches and start showing status in a column.
#### ‚Ä¢ Bulk Operations - No bulk update endpoint exists for disabling multiple branches simultaneously. Currently, the application makes parallel API calls when disabling all reservations, which could hit rate limits with many branches. A batch endpoint like PUT /branches/bulk would be more efficient.
#### ‚Ä¢ Table Reservation Settings - Based on the API documentation, there's no apparent way to update the accepts_reservations flag on individual tables within sections. The edit modal shows tables that already accept reservations, but cannot toggle this setting. This would require endpoints like PUT /sections/:id/tables/:id with updatable accepts_reservations field.

## Final notes
#### ‚Ä¢ Provided demo URL is hosted on a personal AWS Amplify account, and token is being read from environment variables so it doesn't get exposed.
#### ‚Ä¢ The github repo is public at the moment only to allow sharing it with Foodics team.
